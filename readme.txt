This widget displays a list of all of the users that have written content on your site recently, where you can specify the point in time after which you want to consider posts for inclusion in the widget.

The widget options are:

*   Title - set the widget title (or don't show one)
*   Since when - You can either use dynamic, or static date strings to decide how recently content had to be published to be included in the widget. Use strings like 12/31/09, 30 days ago, Monday, -2 weeks. See [strtotime](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php) for more information on dynamic time strings.
*   Link destination - Set whether the author's name should point to their list of posts, their website, or nowhere.
*   Display post count - Decide whether to show how many posts the user has written in the specified time period.
